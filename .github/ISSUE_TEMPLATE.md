Hi there and welcome!

First time posting? Please read EVERYTHING below otherwise YOUR ISSUE WILL BE CLOSED and you will not get any help. We have very little time and these instructions are written to save everyone time.

Chimp is a test runner that combines multiple tools to make end-to-end testing easy. As such, you should seek help for the specific tools at the right channels.

* - - BROWSER AUTOMATION related issues
Please try to get your queries answered with the Webdriver.io team first. Here are some useful links:
- gitter.im/webdriverio/webdriverio
- github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/issues
- webdriver.io/api.html

* - - SELENIUM related issues
Try to get selenium-standalone working WITHOUT CHIMP. So follow the instructions and issues on these pages:
- github.com/vvo/selenium-standalone#command-line-interface
- github.com/vvo/selenium-standalone/issues

* - - CUCUMBER SYNTAX & USAGE related issues
Please try to get your queries answered with the Cucumber team first. Here are some useful links:
- gitter.im/cucumber/cucumber-js
- github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/issues
- cucumber.io/docs/reference/javascript
- github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js#help--support

* - - SOMETHING ELSE
Please post your issues below and make sure you FOLLOW THE FORMAT BELOW. If you do not, we will likely close your issue without warning. We want to help but our time is valuable so you need to put in the right effort to save us time, which is why the format below exists.
