There is nothing special here, you can use federation as you normally would, relevant resolvers and tests will get scaffolded for you, in a properly typed manner. 

Nonetheless, we want to talk through some examples. So, stay tuned - more documentation to come soon.
For now, if you need an inspiration feel free to take a look at the [Examples/Federation](Examples/Federation.md).
