In this section we will turn a basic Apollo-based backend into one that uses our generator.

You can [watch me here](https://youtu.be/w8JpCQP8oag) turn a basic Apollo-based backend into one that uses our generator. 
Alternatively you can [follow through the steps yourself](https://www.xolv.io/dev-notes/adding-chimp-3-to-an-existing-application/), or if you prefer [take a look at the diff here](https://github.com/xolvio/chimp-gql-tiny-example/pull/2)

For an example with a lot more use-cases like Filtering, Pagination, using actual external DataSources and Federation take a look at [Examples/Federation.md]
